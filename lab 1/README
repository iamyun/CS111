lab1a.c:
lab1a.c is the C source module that, in default mode, set the terminal mode to
non-canonical mode, and then print input from keyboard to STDOUT, exit(0), when
encounter ^D. It also has a shell option, which both writes the input from keyboard
to STDOUT as well as to the shell (/bin/bash for our case). When the shell receive
the input, it will execute the input and write the result from shell to STDOUT. This
is done by creating child process using fork(), pipe the two process, and then use
poll to perform the alternation between input from the ketboad and the input from 
the shell. When the program is exited normally in shell mode (exit(0)), it also 
output the exit status. 

Makefile:
default -- compiles the files
clean -- remove the executables and tarballs
dist -- remove the unnecessary files and make a tarball with the specific files

README:
The README file contain identification information, descrition of the files included
in the tarball, the Makefile, the lab1a.c file, and citation of resources that I used
to help me understand the functions
