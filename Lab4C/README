README:
	This README file contains identification information, description of the 
	files included in the tarball (lab4b, Makefile, README), as well as citation 
	of resources that I used to help me implement the program.

lab4c_tcp.c:
	This file contains the C source module for an embedded application that builds
	and runs on an Edison. Its executable reads the temperature from the temperature
	sensor and gets the local time, takes in argument id, host, log, and port number.
	It operates by opening a TCP connection to the server at the specified address
	and port, then immediately send the ID string terminated with a newline: 
	ID=id-number\n, send the temperature reports to server, and process the commands
	received from server over the connection.

lab4c_tls.c:
	Very similar to lab4c_tcp, except that it opens a TLS connection to the server
	using socket and openSSL.

Makefile:
	This is a makefile to build the program and the tarball.
	default:
		default target which builds the program
	clean: 
		removes all makefile-generated programs and output
	dist: 
		create the deliverable tarball
